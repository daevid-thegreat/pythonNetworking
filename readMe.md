# Python Networking

This consist of three projects that I have worked on in Python. The first is a mailer that sends an email to a specified email address. The second is a port scanner that scans a specified IP address for open ports. The third is a web server that serves as a chat room.

## Installation

To install this project, you will need to have Python installed. You can then install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
